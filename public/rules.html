            <p class="paragraph">
                The object of Battleship is to try and sink all of the other player's ships before they sink all of your ships.
                All of the other player's ships are somewhere on his/her grid.
                You try and hit them by clicking on one of the squares on your opponent's grid (The right grid).
                The other player also tries to hit your ships by clicking on one of the squares.
                Neither you nor the other player can see the other's grid so you must try to guess where the ships are.
                Each player in the game has two grids:  the one on the left side for the player's ships and the one on the right side for recording the player's guesses.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Each player places the 5 ships somewhere on their grid (on the left grid).
                The ships can only be placed vertically or horizontally.
                Diagonal placement is not allowed.
                No part of a ship may hang off the edge of the grid.
                Ships may not overlap each other.
                No ships may be placed on another ship.
                <br>
                <br>
                Once the guessing begins, the players cannot move the ships.
                <br>
                <br>
                The 5 ships are:  Carrier (occupies 5 spaces), Battleship (4 spaces), Cruiser (3 spaces), Submarine (3 spaces), and Destroyer (2 spaces).

            <p class="paragraph">
                Player's take turns guessing by clicking on the squares on their opponent's grid (The right grid).
                If your shot was a hit then it will be indicated by a red dot and if your shot was a miss then it will be indicated by a white dot.
                When all of the squares that one your ships occupies have been hit, the ship will be sunk.
                In the game, on your grid (The left grid) you will be able to see your opponent's hits or misses. 
                <br>
                <br>
                As soon as all of one player's ships have been sunk, the game ends.
